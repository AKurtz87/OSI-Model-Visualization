# OSI Model Visualization

This project provides a simple, interactive visualization of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the internal functions of a communication system by partitioning it into abstraction layers.

The project uses basic web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to render the model in a user-friendly way and to add interactivity.

## Features

**Layer-by-Layer Structure:** The model is laid out layer by layer from the application layer down to the physical layer. Each layer has a separate block with a title representing the layer's name.

**Interactive Layers:** By clicking on each layer, you can toggle the visibility of detailed information for that layer, such as the protocols used and a sample data representation.

**Detailed Information:** The detailed information for each layer includes the protocols used at that layer and a visual representation of how data is encapsulated or treated at that layer.

## Setup

+ Clone the repository
  
  >git clone https://github.com/yourusername/osi-model-visualization.git
  
+ Open the HTML file
  
+ Navigate to the project directory and open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

**To use the OSI Model Visualization tool:**

**Click on a layer:** Click on any layer block to reveal the protocols used at that layer and a table demonstrating how data is encapsulated or treated at that layer.

**Click again to hide details:** If you want to hide the details of a layer, simply click on the layer block again.
